# tigerbook-social-network
Tigerbook social network, 2017. Created a text based interface social network capable of allowing multiple users to either: (1) broadcast a message to all users, (2) multicast a message to a group, or (3) unicast a message to a particular user. (4) Display the user's Wall Page, which displays all the messages that are sent by the user, including broadcast, multicast and unicast messages, in reverse chronological order in which they are created. (5) Display the user's home page, which displays all the messages that are received from broadcast, multicast and unicast messages and all of their own messages, in reverse chronological order in which they are created. (6) Create new group for other users to join. (7) Join group already created. (8) Exit the system.
